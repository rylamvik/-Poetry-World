     	Smoke
  		Henry David Thoreau, 1843

  		Light-winged Smoke! Icarian bird,	
  		Melting thy pinions in thy upward flight

  		Lark without song, and messenger of dawn,	
  		Circling above the hamlets as thy nest	

  		Or else, departing dream, and shadowy form
  		Of midnight vision, gathering up thy skirts

  		By night star-veiling, and by day	
  		Darkening the light and blotting out the sun

  		Go thou, my incense, upward from this hearth,	
  		And ask the gods to pardon this clear flame;

      boundaries of self and state
      it’s all yours now

      a(nother) superficial interaction 
      many have done what you’ve done …

      would you do it again?
              it burns away quickly

      see thru time it
      sees thru you
        
        stare into screens
             not eyes
             into serial lies
        
        stay in control
             they said
             let it rob your soul
        
        you having a good time
             on this trip?
              we won’t go far
        
        I should have something
             to leave you with

      Bluebird
      Charles Bukowski, 1986
      
        there's a bluebird in my heart that wants to get out
        but I'm too tough for him,
        I say, stay in there, I'm not going
        to let anybody see you.

        there's a bluebird in my heart that
        wants to get out
        but I pour whiskey on him and inhale
        cigarette smoke
        and the whores and the bartenders
        and the grocery clerks
        never know that he's in there.

        there's a bluebird in my heart that wants to get out
        but I'm too tough for him, I say,
        stay down, do you want to mess me up?
        you want to screw up the works?
        you want to blow my book sales in Europe?
        there's a bluebird in my heart that
        wants to get out
        but I'm too clever, I only let him out
        at night sometimes
        when everybody's asleep.

        I say, I know that you're there,
        so don't be sad.
        then I put him back,
        but he's singing a little
        in there, I haven't quite let him die
        and we sleep together like that with our secret pact
        and it's nice enough to make a man weep,
        but I don't weep, do you?
